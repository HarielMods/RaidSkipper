_Korthia functions removed in favor of the [Korthia Checklist WeakAura](https://wago.io/cyRj6ikQz)_

## TO DO

* Remove Ace library. This addon is so small and Ace is really not needed. 
* Improve multi-character data.
* Add a GUI to show quest skip progress for all characters.
* Update logo and marketing
